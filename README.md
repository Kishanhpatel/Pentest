# Basic Network Penetration for Cyber Dummies

The ability to manipulate a network is an important skill that can be confusing to beginners, hence the goal of this guide is to lay a basic frame work on how to hack most competition network.  All of the tools that are mentioned in this document are free and there is extensive documentation on how to use them on the internet. *Do not use these techniques on an unauthorized network*

## Step 1:  Scanning
### 1.1 Identify live hosts in the target network
The quick and dirty way to do this is through Wireshark. Just run Wireshark on the target network and look at the source and destination IP address of the packets.  If it is listed then that IP is live on the network. 
However if you need to remotely capture packets, then use the linux tool `tcpdump`, which is the same as Wireshark but on the command line. 
```
$ sudo tcpdump
	-n: Use number for machines insted of host names
	-nn: User number for machines and the ports
	-D: list of interfaces
	-v: Print verbose output
	
Ex: To see all packets associated with TCP port 80 going to or from host 10.10.10.10 run:

	# tcpdump -nn tcp and port 80 and host 10.10.10.10
```
### 1.2 Map out the network
Mapping out the network gives valuable information on the network, that can be used for exploitation. On linux the traceroute technique can be used to figure out what route a packet takes in a network to get to a target. Each packet has a property called Time To Live (TTL), which is the number of hops the packet is allowed to make before its dropped.  So by strategically changing the TTL of a packet, you can find out the path the packets take in a network.
```
#traceroute -options [host]
	-f[N]: set the initial TTL for the first packet
	-I: Use ICMP echo request insted of UDP
	-T: Use TCP SYN insted of UDP (for more confidence), default dest port 80
	-m[N]: Set max number of hops
	-n: print numbers insted of names
	-p[port]: port
```
You can also used web based tracerouting services if you are being shunned during a test. Some good ones are `www.traceroute.org` and `www.kloth.net/services/traceroute.php`.
### 1.3 Port Scans
Once we find out what Hosts are up and how we get there, now we need to find out what ports are open on those hosts. `Nmap` is a good tool to do this
```
Ex of Nmap:
# ./nmap -Pn -sS 10.10.0.1 -p 1-1024 --packet-trace
	-Pn: Indicates we dont want to ping the target system: we just want to scan it
	-sS: Indicates that we want a SYN scan (stealth)
	-p 1-1024: Tells Nmap to scan ports 1 through 1024 only
	--packet-trace: Makes Nmap display the status and packet summary information.
More options:
	-PS[portlist]: Sends a TCP SYN packet to each port in list
	-F: stands for fast, only checks the top 100 ports
	--top-ports[N]: scan for the N most popular ports
```
### 1.4 OS Scans

### 1.5 Version Scans of service and protocols on open ports

### 1.6 Vulnerability Scans
